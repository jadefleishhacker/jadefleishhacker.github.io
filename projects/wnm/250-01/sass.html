<p>Sass is a powerful dynamic CSS preprocessor that greatly extends the functionality of traditional CSS. It is a
    meta-language, meaning it sits as a layer on top of standard CSS. Syntactically, Sass looks nearly identical to CSS,
    but it introduces much more functionality in an elegant and fairly easy-to-learn way. Sass has a ton of features,
    and you can choose to use all of them or only a few of them. As you become more familiar with the Sass workflow, you
    can start to branch out and explore more creative uses for it. This scaling of complexity makes for a soft
    introduction and an easier learning curve. With Sass, we are not learning a brand new language so much as building
    upon a language we already know.

    Sass was originally designed by Hampton Catlin, who is also the developer of the Haml markup language. Both Haml and
    Sass were first written in Ruby, the widely popular general-purpose programming language. It has also been ported to
    run on other languages like C and JavaScript in the form of the libsass library.</p>
