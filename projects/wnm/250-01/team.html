            <p class="name">HEAVEN ZHANG</p>
            <p class="title">Founder & CEO</p>
            <p>Heaven was born in China and then moved to Australia. When she lived in China, it was tough for her to
                gain experience
                as a Photographer's assistant due to gender inequality. However when she moved to
                Australia she was able to take classes and develop her own style and have control over her own studio.
                She then moved to California to study at the Academy of Arts University in San Francisco. Here she
                continued her studies
                for another 4 years. She before graduation she started the heavenzjpg photography company.

            <p>Jade was also born in China but then moved to the Netherlands when she was young. After moving to the
                East coast of the
                U.S., she became interested in the art of photography. However, it was until she moved to California
                that she was able
                to study photography. She studied in high school for a couple of years and then studied in the Academy
                of Arts
                University under the Photography major. There she met Heaven and joined her in 2018.
