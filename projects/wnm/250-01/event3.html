            Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web
            designs. The
            passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of
            Cicero's De
            Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:

            “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et
            dolore magna
            aliqua.”
            The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.)
            that doesn't
            distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler text
            can be very
            useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.

            The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer
            sheets, and
            again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen all around
            the web; on
            templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to get your own, or read on for the authoritative
            history of
            lorem ipsum.</p>
