                As we are going through these challenging times with so much uncertainty, things are happening that are
                not in our
                control. One thing we cannot forget is who we are… We are the Yang's Martial Arts Academy! We are a
                community! A
                community supports one another and works through tough times together! To this point, it is important
                that we keep some
                sense of normalcy. It is also very important that we teach by example how we want our children to face
                difficult
                circumstances in their future. We at Yang's Martial Arts are adapting and adjusting to our circumstances
                to ensure we
                are here to serve you our Yang's Martial Arts families.
            </p>
            <p class="c19-2">We are teaching online classes! During this first week, I have been working out the
                technical issues with
                our online
                classes. We will be adjusting our class schedule to accommodate our students’ normal routine as much as
                possible.
