            Hi everyone,
        </p>
        <p class="c19-1 covid-text">
            As we are going through these challenging times with so much uncertainty, things are happening that are
            not in our
            control. One thing we cannot forget is who we are… We are the Yang's Martial Arts Academy! We are a
            community! A
            community supports one another and works through tough times together! To this point, it is important
            that we keep some
            sense of normalcy. It is also very important that we teach by example how we want our children to face
            difficult
            circumstances in their future. We at Yang's Martial Arts are adapting and adjusting to our circumstances
            to ensure we
            are here to serve you our Yang's Martial Arts families.
        </p>
        <p class="c19-2 covid-text">We are teaching online classes! During this first week, I have been working out the
            technical issues with
            our online
            classes. We will be adjusting our class schedule to accommodate our students’ normal routine as much as
            possible.
